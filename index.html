<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I'm teaching statistics at North Carolina State University.</p>

<p>Before coming to NC State, I earned my MS degree in Bioinformatics from Iowa State University and PhD degree in Statistics from Stanford University. My advisers were <a href="http://www.gdcb.iastate.edu/faculty_and_research/bios/kdorman.shtml">Karin Dorman</a> (MS thesis) and the magical <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Ecgates/PERSI/">Persi Diaconis</a> (PhD thesis). I did my post-doc work with Professor <a href="http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702">Kenneth Lange</a> at UCLA and have maintained an active collaboration with him ever since.</p>
