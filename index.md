### Welcome!

I'm teaching statistics at North Carolina State University.

Before coming to NC State, I earned my MS degree in Bioinformatics from Iowa State University and PhD degree in Statistics from Stanford University. My advisers were [Karin Dorman](http://www.gdcb.iastate.edu/faculty_and_research/bios/kdorman.shtml) (MS thesis) and the magical [Persi Diaconis](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Ecgates/PERSI/) (PhD thesis). I did my post-doc work with Professor [Kenneth Lange](http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702) at UCLA and have maintained an active collaboration with him ever since.
