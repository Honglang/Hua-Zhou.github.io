### Welcome!

I'm teaching and doing research in [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.ucla.edu) at [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu) (UCLA). I received my Ph.D. in 2008 from the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu).
