**H Zhou** and K Lange. (2011) A fast procedure for calculating importance weights in bootstrap sampling, _[Computational Statistics & Data Analysis_][18], 55(1):26-33. [[pdf][19]]
The use of importance sampling can dramatically reduce the variance of boostrap estimates. However nowadays the sample size is often huge, say at order of 10^6-10^9. Then the calculation of importance weights becomes nontrivial. Here we propose a fast procedure that scales well with sample size.

**H Zhou** and K Lange. (2010) On the bumpy road to the dominant mode, _[Scandinavian Journal of Statistics_][26], 37:612-631. [[pdf][27]]
We propose several variants of deterministic annealing for finding the dominant mode in maximum likelihood estimation with some classical statistical problems.**H Zhou** and K Lange. (2010) MM algorithms for some discrete multivariate distributions, _[Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics][28], _19(3):656-665. [[pdf][29]]

We designed MM algorithms (a generalization of the EM algorithm) for maximum likelihood estimation of some multivariate distributions frequently occurring in applications. Specific examples include Dirichlet-Multinomial, generalized Dirichlet-Multinomial, negative multinomial, a distribution due to Neerchal and Morel, the Ewens and Pitman sampling distributions, and the zero-truncated and zero-inflated version of these distributions.

Clinical implications of the cancer extinction model are summarized in this paper.

**H Zhou** and K Lange. (2009) Rating movies and rating the raters who rate them, _[The American Statistician][32]_, 63(4):297â€“307. [[pdf][33]]
If you ever heard of [Netflix grand prize][34], you might be interested in reading this short report. Instead of the prediction problem challenged by Netflix, we focus more on the modeling. Our simple model is able to identify quirky raters, supply a ranking of movies, and should be able to predict unseen ratings. We only fit the model to the [MovieLens][35] data set. Interested readers should try this on the (much larger) Netflix data set.

**H Zhou** and K Lange. (2009) Composition Markov chains of multinomial type, _[Advances in Applied Probability][36]_, 41(1):270-291. [[pdf][37]]
We describe a class of Markov chains that take a system of multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials constructed by [Robert Griffiths][38] as eigenfunctions. It is motivated by an interesting light bulb problem first studied by [Rao, Rao, and Zhang][39]. It is nice to make connection between this little problem with some results on orthogonal polynomials.

K Khare and **H Zhou**. (2009) Rates of convergence of some multivariate Markov chains with polynomial eigenfunctions, _[Annals of Applied Probability][40]_, 19(2):737-777. [[pdf][41]]
We obtaine the convergence rates of the multivariate versions of several classical Markov chains using spectral method. Specific examples include the multivariate Moran process in population genetics and its variants in community ecology, Dirichlet-Multinomial Gibbs sampler, generalizations of Ehrenfest chains, multivariate normal autoregressive processes, and so on.

**H Zhou** and K Dorman. (2005) A branching process model of drug resistant HIV, book chapter in _Deterministic and stochastic models of AIDS epidemics and HIV infections with intervention_, 457-496, World Sci. Publ., Hackensack, NJ.
We apply the numerical methods for continuous-time multi-type branching processes with immigration to study the development of drug-resistant HIV in vivo.

**H Zhou**. (2006) Scrambling a Rubik's cube. [[pdf][42]]
We compute the character tables of the pocket cube (2-by-2-by-2 Rubik's cube) group and the Rubik's cube group and considered some specific random walks on these groups. The question of  "How many twists are needed to thoroughly scramble the full Rubic's cube?" is still open.
