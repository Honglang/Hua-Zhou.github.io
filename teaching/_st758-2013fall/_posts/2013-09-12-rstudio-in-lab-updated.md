Terry has updated the RStudio software for most computers in computer labs this morning, *except* machines in SICL, the Commons, and the tutorial rooms. There should be no problems compiling the R code into HTML on these machines now. Please feel free to let us (<hua_zhou@ncsu.edu> or <tbyron@ncsu.edu>) know if you still encounter issues.
