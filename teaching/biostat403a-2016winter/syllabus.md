### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory.

### Homework

You will be required to hand in several homework and lab assignments throughout the quarter. Homework and lab assignments count for about half of the final grade. 

### Exam

There will likely be 2 quizzes during the quarter, each counting for about 15% of the final grade. The quizzes will be in-class and closed book. The final counts for about 20% of the final grade.

### Final Grade

Grades will be based on the homework and class assignments (50%), the quizzes (30%) and the final (20%). Auditors must earn a respectable D to gain recording of this course.
