### Project

There will be a course project, which carries twice the weight of a homework assignment.

### Academic Integrity

Cheating will not be tolerated. See the university’s policy on academic integrity at [http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01). You may work together on homework assignments, but simply giving or receiving answers or code to or from another student is cheating. Cheating also includes copying from another student's paper, using unauthorized materials during exams, and falsifying data.

### Disability

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509, 515-7653.
