Homework 4 and 5 are posted on the [schedule](../../../schedule.html) page. Both assignments consider different approaches to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the Dirichlet-Multinomial model. HW4 is due Nov 12; HW5 is due Nov 19. Please start early so you won't be overwhelmed by all kinds of deadlines in Nov. 

When submitting your homework, follow these rules:  
* submit hardcopy: paper + code + output  
* email code (only) to me <hua_zhou@ncsu.edu> with subject like `ST758 HW4` and file name `unityIDhw4.r`
* use of [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is highly recommended  
* code should have clear and plenty of comments and `rm(list=ls())` at top and bottom  
* your code should never exceed 80 characters in width  
* follow a good coding style; read [Google's R style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)
