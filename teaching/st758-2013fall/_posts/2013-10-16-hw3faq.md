* I didn't find any dangling pages in this data set.  
Some of you found there are no dangling pages (pages with no links on it) in this data set. This is caused by an error I made when preparing the input files! Actually the link data in the `A.txt` file is the *transpose* of the A matrix I described in HW3. After transposing it, I find there are 97 dangling pages.
* Do self-links count?  
Yes they do.
* What do you mean by *visualize the sparsity pattern*?  
I mean something like below, which is produced by the `spy()` function in Matlab. There might be analog in R. Such visualization tools are extremely helpful in exploratory data analysis. ![](./A_sparsity.png) 
* What are those urls `http://www`?  
I think they appear in the template of the urls being parsed, and the web crawler I used wrongly recognizes this as a web address. I would treat them as regular urls and see what happens.
* Where can I read about the PageRank algorithm?  
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) has a good introduction. The book *Experiments With MATLAB* by Cleve Moler also has a [chapter](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/exm/chapters/pagerank.pdf) on PageRank.
