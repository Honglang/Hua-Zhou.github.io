PDF of lecture notes is posted on the [schedule](../../../schedule.html) page. It'll be updated after each lecture. These notes use a relatively large font size for better readability during lecture. To save trees, you may print the two pages per sheet version and double sided. I will appreciate if you let me know any errors and typos in the lecture notes.
