* Do we have to implement the SVD algorithm for Q2 and Q3?  
No, just use the `svd` function in `R`. It is calling the LAPACK subroutine for SVD. It's unlikely we can beat BLAS or LAPACK.

* Hint for Q1?  
Use one fact we showed (by induction) in class: the Cholesky factor of a pd matrix is unique.
