* Q1: What's the notation $\binom{|\boldsymbol{x}|}{\boldsymbol{x}}$?   
This is the multinomial coefficient   
$$
	\binom{|\boldsymbol{x}|}{\boldsymbol{x}} = \binom{|\boldsymbol{x}|}{x_1 \, \cdots \, x_d} = \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^d x_i)!}{x_1! \cdots x_d!}.
$$

* Q2: Concavity of the log-likelihood function?   
For the concavity of the log-likelihood, we observe that it is some log terms (concave) *minus* some other log terms (concave). We would suspect it is not concave in general. To show that something is not concave, it suffices to give one counter example. Q7 gives some hints when the observed information matrix is not pd.  Later when you do Q10, if you purposely start your algorithm from a bad starting point, often you'll find that the observed information matrix is not pd at the first few iterates. That also suffices as a proof the log-likelihood is not concave.
