* Q2: Matrices $A$ and $B$ are not symmetric!  
Note only entries in the upper triangular part are defined ($j \ge i$) for $A$ and $B$. Lower entries are determined by symmetry.

* Hints for Q2?  
Statisticians have a powerful way to show a matrix is p.s.d. That is to show that the matrix is the covariance matrix of a random vector. For matrix $A$, we consider the order statistics of $n$ iid uniform random variables on [0, 1]. For matrix $B$, we consider random variables 
$$
Y_i = X_1 + \cdots X_i,
$$
where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are independent random variables with variances $\sigma_1^2, \ldots, \sigma_n^2$ respectively. These two examples are due to Ingram Olkin (1985) [_A probabilistic proof of a theorem of Schur_](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2322195)

* Q4, Q5: Do you want us to code everything from scratch like writing triple loops for matrix multiplications and so on?  
No, I just want you to make educated choice of numerical linear algebra functions in ``R``. For both Q4 and Q5, I expect no more than 20 lines of R code.

* Q4: I see no way to avoid loop here :(  
Probably you are right, I don't see obvious way to avoid loop in this case too.
