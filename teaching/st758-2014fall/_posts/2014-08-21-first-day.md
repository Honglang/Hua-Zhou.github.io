PDF of lecture notes is posted on the [schedule](../../../../schedule.html) page. *Pre-lecture notes* will posted before each lecture and *Cumulative lecture notes* will be updated after each lecture. These notes use a large font size for better readability during lecture. To save trees, you may print two pages per sheet and double sided. I will appreciate if you let me know any errors and typos in the lecture notes.
