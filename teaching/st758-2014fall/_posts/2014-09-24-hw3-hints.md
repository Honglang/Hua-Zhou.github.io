Some FAQs during office hours are collected here:

* Q3(a): What do you mean by adding an intercept?  
Add a column of ones to the covariate matrix $X$.

* Q3(a): Shall we make year a categorical variable?  
Treat it as a quantitative variable.

* Q3(b): Do you want us to use each method (QR, Cholesky, sweep) to find the regression coefficients, their s.e., and $\hat \sigma^2$, or you want us to determine which method is most efficient?  
I want you to try these three methods for linear regression. No need to do efficiency comparison.

* What the heck is that `pivot` from the output of `qr` and `chol` functions in R? How to use it?  
The function `qr` by default calls the LINPACK routine `dqrdc` and produces $XP = QR$. Read documentation at [https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/appl/dqrdc.f](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/appl/dqrdc.f) *jpvt(k) contains the index of the column of the original matrix that has been interchanged into the k-th column, if pivoting was requested.* Based on this, for a matrix $M$ of compatible sizes, the following shall be true: 
  * `M[, pivot] == M %*% t(P)`
  * `M[, order(pivot)] == M %*% P`
  * `M[pivot, ] == P %*% M`
  * `M[order(pivot), ] == t(P) %*% M`.
