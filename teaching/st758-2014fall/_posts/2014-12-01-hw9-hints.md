* Can I use loop?   
It's a hard question to answer. A better question is _can I avoid loop here_? It's ok to loop over different combination of levels. For Dirilet-multinomial MLE, ridge, and lasso, we have to loop over simulation replicates within a simulation setting.

* The run time is excessively long. What can I do?   
	* Make sure to temper the complexity of your study with your ability to address an issue clearly and completely.
	* Optimize your code as much as possible (vectorize code)
	* Check out the `parallel` package in `R` for multithreading and general parallel computing. Demo code: [http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/zhou/courses/st810/notes/vcsim.r](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/zhou/courses/st810/notes/vcsim.r)
	
* How to generate correlated predictors in $X$?   
We can use either AR(1) model or equi-correlation model.

* How to set random seeds?   
I don't know of a fixed rule for setting random seeds in simulation study. I routinely use a separate seed for each combination of levels. So I can easily reproduce results for a specific setting without saving the whole mess of data.


* How to choose number of simulation replicates $S$ for each setting? Do I need to justify my choice?   
We are statisticians; we need to choose $S$ such that the last digit you report in your table is significant. Read Dr Marie Davidian's slides, especially page 22 -33.
