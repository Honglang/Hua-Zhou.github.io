### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory.

### Homework

Approximately 6-8 homework assignments will be assigned involving both analysis and computation. 

### Project

There will be a simulation project, which carries twice the weight of a homework assignment.

### Exam

There will be a final exam (in-class or take-home) that involves computation and will carry twice the weight of a homework assignment.

### Final Grade

Letter grade will be assigned based on the final score: 60% homework + 20% project + 20% final exam.

### Academic Integrity

Cheating will not be tolerated. See the university’s policy on academic integrity at [http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01). You may work together on homework assignments, but simply giving or receiving answers or code to or from another student is cheating. Cheating also includes copying from another student's paper, using unauthorized materials during exams, and falsifying data.

### Disability

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509, 515-7653. For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation (REG02.20.01)
