Welcome to Biostat M280 *Statistical Computing*. 

Whether you register for the class or not, please fill out a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZLY9R6Y). It helps me better taylor the course to your background.

PDF of lecture notes is posted on the [schedule](../../../../schedule.html) page. *Pre-lecture notes* will be posted before each lecture and *Cumulative lecture notes* will be updated after each lecture. These notes use a large font size for better readability during lecture. If you want to print them, use two pages per sheet and double-sided to save trees. I will appreciate if you let me know any errors and typos in the lecture notes.
