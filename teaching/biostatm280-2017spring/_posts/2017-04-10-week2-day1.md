* [_Julia: a fresh approach to numerical computing_](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/readings/BezansonEdelmanKarpinskiShah17Julia.pdf) by Bezanson, Edelman, Karpinski, and Shah (2017)

## Last time

* Basic Julia programming. 

## Today

* Instructor (Dr. Zhou) may be late for the class. In that case, TA (Juhyun Kim) will play a lecture video by Jack Dongarra (creator of LINPACK, LAPACK). His lecture provides excellent historical background for the first major topic of the course: numerical linear algebra.  

* Dr. Zhou will resume the lecture as soon as he arrives campus. Today's topics are basic Julia programming (continued) and reproducible research (git, github, IJulia).
