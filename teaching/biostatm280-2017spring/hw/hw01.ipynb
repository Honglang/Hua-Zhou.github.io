    "0. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Create two branches `master` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `master` branch will be your presentation area. Put your homework submission files (IJulia notebook `.ipynb`, html converted from notebook, all code and data set to reproduce results) in `master` branch.  \n",

Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your hw1 submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.  \n",
