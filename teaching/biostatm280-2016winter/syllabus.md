### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory.

### Homework

You will be required to hand in 6-8 homework assignments throughout the quarter.  

### Exam

There will be a couple quizzes during the quarter. The quizzes will be in-class and closed book.

### Final Grade

Grades will be based on the homework (70%) and the quizzes (30%). Auditors must earn a respectable D to gain recording of this course.

### Academic Integrity

See the university’s policy on academic integrity at [http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/StudentGuide.pdf](http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/StudentGuide.pdf). You may discuss with your fellow students on homework assignments, but simply giving or receiving answers or code to or from another student is cheating. Cheating also includes copying from another student’s paper or code, using unauthorized materials during exams, and falsifying data.
