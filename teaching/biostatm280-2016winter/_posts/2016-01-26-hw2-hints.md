Some FAQs during office hours are collected here:

* Hints for Q2?  
Statisticians have a powerful way to show a matrix is p.s.d. That is to show that the matrix is the covariance matrix of a random vector. For matrix $A$, consider the order statistics of $n$ iid uniform random variables on [0, 1]. 

* Q4, Q5: Do you want us to code everything from scratch like writing triple loops for matrix multiplications and so on?  
No, I just want you to make educated choice of numerical linear algebra functions in R. For both Q4 and Q5, I expect no more than 20 lines of R code.

* How do I do LU decomposition in `R`?  
Use the `Matrix` package in `R`, which is written by Doug Bates. `lua <- lu(A)` does the LU decomposition with partial pivoting $PA = LU$. Result is stored in a compact format. To retrieve the factors `L`, `U`, and the permutation matrix `P`, use `luafact <- expand(lua)`.
