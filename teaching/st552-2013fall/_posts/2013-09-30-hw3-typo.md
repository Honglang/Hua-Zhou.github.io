There are at least two typos in Homework 3.  
* Q4: $$Z_n = (X+nY) \text{mod} 2$$ should be $$Z_n = (X+nY) \text{mod} 3$$  
* Q6(b): $$\text{trace}(\Omega_2) \ge \text{trace}(\Omega)$$ should be $$\text{trace}(\Omega_2) \ge \text{trace}(\Omega_1)$$  
Both are corrected in the [pdf](../../../ST552-2013-HW3.pdf) now.
