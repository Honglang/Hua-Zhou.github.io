Here is a list of typos in Homework 4.  
* Q1(b): $${\cal C}(X^T V^{-1} X) = {\cal C}(X)$$ should be $${\cal C}(X^T V^{-1} X) = {\cal C}(X^T)$$  
They are corrected in the [pdf](../../../ST552-2013-HW4.pdf) now.
* Q2(b): $$RG^-R^T (RG^-R^T)^-RG^-\Lambda = RG^-\Lambda$$ should be "RG^-R^T (RG^-R^T)^-RG^-\Lambda^T = RG^-\Lambda^T"
* Q5(e): The lower right block of matrix in the last equation should be $$B^-B$$.
