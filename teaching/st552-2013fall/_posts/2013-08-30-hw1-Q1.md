There has been some confusion how to show that the maximum number of linearly independent rows is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent columns. Here are some possible arguments

* Argument 1  
Let \$A\$ has size \$m\$-by-\$n\$. Let the maximal number of linearly independent rows be \$r\$ and the maximal number of linearly independent columns be \$c\$. We want to show that \$r=c\%. Let's collect a set of \$r\$ linearly independent rows into a \$r\$-by-\$n\$ matrix \$R\$. Then the rows of \$A\$ are spanned by the rows of \$R\$. Therefore \$A = BR\$, where \$B\$ is a \$m\$-by-\$r\$ matrix. Then we have \$c \le r\$ (why?) By a similar argument (do it!), we have \$r \le c\$. Hence \$r=c\$.

* Argument 2
