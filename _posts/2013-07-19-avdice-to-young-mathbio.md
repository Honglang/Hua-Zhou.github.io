"Have you see this note by Ken before?" My friend Ake asked me the other day.  Actually Ken never bothers to publish this note. 

Here is one I really wish someone told me when I was 20:  
  
> Get a broad undergraduate education in the sciences, emphasizing biology, chemistry, classical physics, applied mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  
> Enroll in medical school if strongly motivated â€¦ Skip the prolonged residency programs after medical school. Do you want to reach middle age before you embark on research?

I spent 6 years in a medical school, wondering whether I really want to be a doctor. We had one semester of linear algebra and calculus and one semester of probability and statistics. I heard about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium from the elective epidemiology course. That's about all quantitative training I got from college. Now I'm making a living by doing/teaching statistics and enjoy it.
