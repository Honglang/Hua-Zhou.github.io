title: Ken's Advice to Young Mathematical Biologists
---

"Have you seen this [note](../../../../media/pdf/Lange-Advice.pdf) by Ken before?" My friend Ake asked me the other day. [Ken](http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702) is my post-doc mentor. We've co-authored about 20 papers but I don't know existence of this note.  Actually Ken never bothers to publish this note. 

Here is one I really wish someone told me when I was in college:  
  
> Get a broad undergraduate education in the sciences, emphasizing biology, chemistry, classical physics, applied mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  
> Enroll in medical school if strongly motivated … Skip the prolonged residency programs after medical school. Do you want to reach middle age before you embark on research?

I spent 6 years in a medical school and ended up wondering whether I really want to be a doctor. I had one semester of linear algebra and calculus and one semester of probability and statistics. I heard about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium from the elective epidemiology course. That's about all quantitative training I got in college. Now I'm making a living by doing/teaching statistics and enjoy it. So often I'm regretting what if I knew this in college!

I, probably like any other junior faculty, find myself juggling all the time: teaching courses for the first time, taking care of students, 
> Other things being equal, finish the job that is nearest done.  

Ken quotes Fred Mosteller (my PhD advisor's PhD advisor).

Several of Ken's advice on writing draw on the classic *The Elements of Style* by Strunk and White. I later bought this little book from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1374269632&sr=8-1e), and found it the best investment of my $9. The authors of this classic were able to break complicated style into easy-to-remember … 

Complement to the Strunk and White, which is for general writing style, the book *A Primer of Mathematical Writing* by Krantz pertains more to mathematical writing. [Guenther Walther](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/people/faculty/walther/) recommended this to all fresh PhD students. I forgot in which class. I bought it but never read it until later into my career. It covers useful things from writing mathematical papers, cv, recommendation later, reviews, to giving mathematical talks.
